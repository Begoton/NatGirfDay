        <p class="cyan">HAPPY NATIONAL GIRLFRIEND DAY!!</p>
        <p class="red">Dear haylie</p><br>  
        <p>I am(hopefully) the closest you have to a boyfriend and I still
            tell people I'm taken so I have some things to tell you.
            When I said I was trying to get you to tell me what you were gonna tell me,
            I was realy making this. I want to be the one to tell you: Happy Girlfriend day :)

        </p>
        
        <p>I knew the whole time I wanted to make you feel special tho.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="center">Hazel, you are the spark that keeps me going and that keeps me happy. 
            You're the one that light up my day and that makes me wanna wake up in the moring and 
            exited to start the day. Exited to take on all the challanged I might be faced with.
            And brave because of you.
            Exited because of you, and happy because of you.
            Just a little girl I met in school has such a great impact on me today.
            And I thank you for that. 

            I love all of out little memories that keep popping up on my phone.
            All the little jolts of energy they give me.
            And that jolt of energy is not just because It's you, but because even tho 
            you're the same girl I met roughly 280 days ago, you still give me that same 
            butterfly feeling in my stomach.
            That amazing feeling comes with joy and acception and greatfullness. And occasionally 
            some exitment down there if you know what I mean but that dosent matter.
            At least telling you that is not out of the ordinairy cus im a bit different.
            But thats another thing, I'm so comfortable with you it's not even funny.
            I am more comfortable with telling you things than anyone else on this planet, 
            not even my own parents. Not even butt nut. And I say some pretty personal shit to that 
            dude.
            He knows me very well, i met him 6 years ago. You know me inside and out, every 
            insecurity and issue, every memorie every weird thing I like to do. Absolutely everything.
            And I havn't even known you for a full year yet. And if you were curius about our little 
            snap streak thing of what is going to be 236, that is 7.75 months, 33.71 weeks, 5,664 hours,
            339,840 minutes and 20,390,400 seconds. Thats pretty crazy. And those have been the 
            greatest times of my life. You've showed me so many wondefull things in life and brought me on
            amazing jouneys that I would not have gon on by myself, but you were there with me by
            my side, and that is the only reason I went. Because I was with you. 
            And like I said, you give me confidence. And with all jokes aside my love, I am so glad.
            I am so glad you were there when I had sex for the first time. I'm glad you were
            there for my first cigarette. I'm glad you were there for my first marijuana high with my friends.
            I'm glad you were the first girl ive snuck out to meet. I'm glad you were there when your
            parent caught us, and when they forgave us. I'm glad you were there. I'm glad you were mine.
            I'm glad you shifted my perspective. I'm glad hazel. You made me the person I am today.
            So thank you.
            With that said, happy national girlfriends day, I Love You. 
            Much Love
